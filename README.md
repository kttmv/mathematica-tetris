# mathematica-tetris
A Mathematica notebook-based non-interactive simulation of Tetris with randomized movements. This was a project for my math modeling with Mathematica class in university.

In the game's initiation, a tetromino with a random rotation is generated. Each turn, the tetromino has a 50% chance to move left or right before descending one block. The cycle repeats until no cells are available for new tetrominos.
